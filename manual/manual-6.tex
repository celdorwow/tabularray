\chapter{Tips and Tricks}

\section{Control Horizontal Alignment}

You can control horizontal alignment of cells in \texttt{tabularray} with
\href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/ragged2e}{\texttt{ragged2e}} package,
by redefining some of the following commands:

\begin{codehigh}
\RenewDocumentCommand\TblrAlignBoth{}{\justifying}
\RenewDocumentCommand\TblrAlignLeft{}{\RaggedRight}
\RenewDocumentCommand\TblrAlignCenter{}{\Centering}
\RenewDocumentCommand\TblrAlignRight{}{\RaggedLeft}
\end{codehigh}

Please read the documentation of \texttt{ragged2e} package for more details of
their alignment commands.

\section{Use Safe Verbatim Commands}%
\label{sec:fakeverb}

Due to the limitations of TeX,
we are not able to make \CC{\verb} command behave well inside \PP{tabularray} tables.
As a replacement, you may use \CC{\fakeverb} command from \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/codehigh}{\PP{codehigh}} package.

The \CC{\fakeverb} command will remove the backslashes in the following control symbols before
typesetting its content: \CC{\\\\}, \CC{\\\{}, \CC{\\\}}, \CC{\\\#}, \CC{\\\^} and \texttt{\textbackslash\textvisiblespace}, \CC{\\\%}.
Also the argument of \CC{\fakeverb} command need to be enclosed with curly braces.
Therefore it could be safely used inside \PP{tabularray} tables and other LaTeX commands.

Here is an example of using \CC{\fakeverb} commands inside a \EE{tblr} environment:

\begin{demohigh}
\begin{tblr}{hlines}
  Special & \fakeverb{\abc{}$&^_^uvw 123} \\
  Spacing & \fakeverb{\bfseries\ \#\%}    \\
  Nesting & \fbox{\fakeverb{$\left\\\{A\right.$\#}}
\end{tblr}
\end{demohigh}

In the above example, balanced curly braces and control words (such as \CC{\bfseries})
need not to be escaped---only several special characters need to be escaped.
Please read the documentation of \PP{codehigh} package for more details of
\CC{\fakeverb} commands.%
\footnote{By the way, \CC{\EscVerb} command from
\href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/fvextra}{\PP{fvextra}} package is similar to
\CC{\fakeverb} command, but with \CC{\EscVerb} you need to escape every control word.}

\section{Blank Lines around Cells}

In \PP{tabularray} tables, there could be a blank line before a cell, after a cell,
or between table commands and cell text. Here is an example:

\begin{demohigh}
\begin{tblr}{rl}

\hline

  One

  &

  Two

  \\

\hline

  Three

  &

  Four

  \\

\hline

\end{tblr}
\end{demohigh}

But more blank lines are not supported.
Therefore putting more than one blank line at any of these positions may cause wrong result.
