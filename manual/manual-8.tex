\chapter{History and Future}

\section{The future}

As a policy, \PP{tabularray} can support at most four TeX Live releases with latest updates.
For example, \PP{tabularray} releases published in \the\year{} could be used in TeX Live
\inteval{\year-3}--\the\year{} with latest updates.

To make the upcoming releases more stable, you are very welcome to test the latest package file
in the repository. To test it, you only need to download the following \FF{tabularray.sty}
and put it into the folder of your TeX documents:\newline
\centerline{\url{https://github.com/lvjr/tabularray/raw/main/tabularray.sty}}

\section{The history}

The change log of \PP{tabularray} package will be updated on the wiki page:\newline
\centerline{\url{https://github.com/lvjr/tabularray/wiki/ChangeLog}}

When \PP{tabularray} makes some breaking changes of \emph{stable public} interfaces in a new release,
you will be able to roll back to previous release to make your existing documents unaffected.

Normally you don't know when there will be a new breaking release.
To keep your old documents as they are, you may add the date of current release
to the last optional argument of \CC{\usepackage} in loading \PP{tabularray},
such as \CC{\usepackage{tabularray}[=2024-02-16]}.
